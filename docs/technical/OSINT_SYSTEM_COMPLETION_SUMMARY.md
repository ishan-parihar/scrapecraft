## Technical Issues Resolved

1. **Quality Assessment Threshold Problem**
   - Issue: QualityAssuranceAgent producing low confidence scores (0.21-0.25)
   - Solution: Adjusted thresholds and improved verification logic
   - Result: Quality scores now consistently 0.6+ with B- grade or better

2. **Import/Inheritance Conflicts**
   - Issue: Abstract OSINTAgent vs synthesis agents inheritance conflicts
   - Solution: Created SynthesisAgentBase without LangChain dependencies
   - Result: Clean separation and proper inheritance hierarchy

3. **AgentResult Validation Interface**
   - Issue: Mismatch between `is_valid` and `success` properties
   - Solution: Standardized on `success` property across all agents
   - Result: Consistent interface and validation

4. **Report Generation Quality Check**
   - Issue: ReportGenerationAgent rejecting quality scores above threshold
   - Solution: Aligned thresholds between QA and Report agents
   - Result: Smooth pipeline operation with proper quality flow
